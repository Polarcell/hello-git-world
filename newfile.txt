Using this tutorial:

git init the directory first
adding a new file with git add, and then git commit (could use git commit -a to do both at the same time)

To add to GitHub, use 
git remote add origin <remote_url>, 
where the remote url is gotten from GitHub new repository.  Need to set that up remotely

Github uses main instead of master, so use 
git branch -m main

You will have to probably pull from the repo first, so use
git pull origin main

Then use git push -u origin main

using https links: 
probably want to adjust the password cache timeout
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
